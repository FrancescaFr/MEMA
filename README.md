## Methane Ebullition Measurement Apparatus (MEMA) Documentation Page

*This page attempts to provide all relevant documentation developed during the design, construction, programming, and testing of MEMA, a device designed to measure methane emmisions from lakes and reservoirs.*

**Page Contents:**

+ CODE : Original Arduino Run and Testing Code, as well as 3rd party code I used to get peripherals up and running + useful libraries.

+ DIAGRAMS : Schematics of the MEMA Internals + 3rd party circuit schematics for Arduino board and peripherals.
+ PARTS_BOM : List of all parts used in the assembly, their cost and suppliers, as well as spec sheets for sensors and parts of interest.
+ PICTURES : Photos of MEMA in various iterations + the guts/ test dilution chamber.
+ TESTS_DATA : Raw csv data from MEMA, spreadsheets with data analysis + images of MATLAB curve fits.

+ MEMA_Thesis_Report : Final Report Summarizing project and results.
+ Original_Project_Proposal : First version of project proposal, to show you where I started from / what the original research question looked like.
